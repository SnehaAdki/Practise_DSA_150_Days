# Hint
# Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

# You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.



# Example 1:
# Input: nums = [2,2,1]
# Output: 1

# Example 2:
# Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]
# Output: 4

# Example 3:
# Input: nums = [1]
# Output: 1
