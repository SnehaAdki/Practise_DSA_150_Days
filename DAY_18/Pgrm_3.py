# 191. Number of 1 Bits
# https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-1-bits/submissions/1862505400/


# Given a positive integer n, write a function that returns the number of set bits in its binary representation (also known as the Hamming weight).



# Example 1:
# Input: n = 11
# Output: 3
# Explanation:
# The input binary string 1011 has a total of three set bits.

# Example 2:
# Input: n = 128
# Output: 1
# Explanation:
# The input binary string 10000000 has a total of one set bit.

# Example 3:
# Input: n = 2147483645
# Output: 30
# Explanation:
# The input binary string 1111111111111111111111111111101 has a total of thirty set bits.



class Solution:

    def hammingWeight(self, n: int) -> int:
        count = 1
        while n != 1:
            count += n%2
            n = n//2

        return count
