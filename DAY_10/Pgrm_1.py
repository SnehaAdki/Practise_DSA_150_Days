# A phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.

# Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, or false otherwise.


# Example 1:
# Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
# Output: true
# Explanation: "amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome.

# Example 2:
# Input: s = "race a car"
# Output: false
# Explanation: "raceacar" is not a palindrome.

# Example 3:
# Input: s = " "
# Output: true
# Explanation: s is an empty string "" after removing non-alphanumeric characters.
# Since an empty string reads the same forward and backward, it is a palindrome.


class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, s: str) -> bool:
        arr = []
        for i in s:
            if i.isalnum():
                arr.append(i.lower())
        print(''.join(arr))
        return arr[::-1] == arr[::]
